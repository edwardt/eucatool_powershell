Description: managing cloud instances for Eucalyptus
 EUCALYPTUS is an open source service overlay that implements elastic
 computing using existing resources. The goal of EUCALYPTUS is to allow
 sites with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an
 elastic computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon's EC2.
 .
 Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs
 To Useful Systems - is an open-source software infrastructure for
 implementing "cloud computing" on clusters.  Eucalyptus Systems is the
 pioneer in open source cloud computing technology that delivers hybrid
 cloud deployments for enterprise data centers. Leveraging Linux and web
 service technologies that commonly exist in today's IT infrastructure,
 Eucalyptus enables customers to quickly and easily create elastic clouds
 in minutes. This "no lock-in" approach provides users with ultimate
 flexibility when delivering their SLAs.
 .
 Eucalyptus is more than just virtualization. Along with building virtual
 machines, the technology supports the network and storage infrastructure
 within the cloud environment. Eucalyptus works with multiple flavors
 of Linux including Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Debian, and CentOS. Eucalyptus
 currently supports Xen and KVM hypervisors.  These tools are meant to
 be CLI compatible with the ec2-api-tools.
