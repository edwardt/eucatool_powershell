Euca2ools: Command-line tools for interacting with Amazon EC2 and S3 
           API-compatible Web services using the REST/Query API.

These instructions describe how to install and run Euca2ools.  Please, 
see the README file for general information and the COPYING file for 
the license for this software.

============
Installation
============

Euca2ools can be installed from source or as a binary package (DEB
or RPM).  The latest source tarball and binary packages can be found here:

  http://open.eucalyptus.com/downloads 

Please, download the correct package for your distribution or the tarball.
Euca2ools are written in Python, relying on the Boto AWS library and 
the M2Crypto cryptography and SSL toolkit.  The acceptable 
versions for the dependencies are:

  Python   2.5 (dev) or higher
  Boto     1.9b
  M2Crypto 0.20.2 or higher 

If you are installing from source, you will need to download euca2ools-1.0-src-deps.tar.gz, which contains 
boto-1.9b.tar.gz and M2Crypto-0.20.2.tar.gz.
 
- If you are installing a binary package, please, follow the standard
process on your distribution for installing euca2ools package and the
prerequisites.

When installing RPMs, the tools are placed in /opt/euca2ools, so you
may want to update your $PATH and $MANPATH accordingly:

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/euca2ools/bin
export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/euca2ools/man

- To install from source, build the dependencies and install as follows:

You will need to install python-dev, swig and libssl-dev to build the following libraries.

# Install Boto

tar zvxf euca2ools-1.0-src-deps.tar.gz
cd euca2ools-1.0-src-deps
tar zxvf boto-1.9b.tar.gz
cd boto-1.9b
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..

# Install M2Crypto
tar zxvf M2Crypto-0.20.2.tar.gz
cd M2Crypto-0.20.2
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..

# Install Euca2ools in /usr/local/bin, adding it to your $PATH, if necessary

cd ..
tar zxvf euca2tools-1.0.tar.gz
cd euca2tools-1.0

sudo make

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH (not necessary on most installations)

============
Uninstalling
============

sudo make clean

You may also wish to delete euca2ools, boto and M2Crypto from your python package installation directory.

=======
Running
=======

Euca2ools use cryptographic credentials for authentication.  Two types of
credentials are issued by EC2- and S3-compatible services: x509 certificates
and keys.  While some commands only require the latter, it is best to always
specify both types of credentials.  Furthermore, unless the front end Web services 
reside on 'localhost', the URLs of the EC2- and S3-compatible service 
endpoints must also be specified.

The credentials and URLs can be specified via the command line option 
or by setting environment variables as follows:

  variable        option                    explanation
  --------------- ------------------------- --------------------------------
  EC2_URL         -U or --url <url>         http://host:8773/services/Eucalyptus
                                            or http://ec2.amazonaws.com
  S3_URL          -U or --url <url>         http://host:8773/services/Walrus
                                            or http://s3.amazonaws.com
  EC2_ACCESS_KEY  -a or --access-key <key>  Access Key ID / Query ID
  EC2_SECRET_KEY  -s or --secret-key <key>  Secret Access Key / Secret Key 
  EC2_CERT        -c or --cert <file>       user's PEM-encoded certificate
  EC2_PRIVATE_KEY -k or --privatekey <file> user's PEM-encoded private key
  EUCALYPTUS_CERT --ec2cert_path <file>     OPTIONAL path to cloud cert

If you are running Euca2ools against Eucalyptus, sourcing the "eucarc" 
file that is included as part of the credentials zip-file that you 
downloaded from the Eucalyptus Web interface should be enough to set up 
all of the above variables correctly.

To get started, try:

euca-describe-availability-zones
AVAILABILITYZONE	mycluster	  UP mycluster.mydomain

For more information, try the --help option of the individual commands. E.g.,

  euca-describe-availability-zones --help

or check the man pages. For example,

  man euca-describe-availability-zones
